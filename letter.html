            Thank you for saying yes to being my valentine this year! I know that I took longer
            <br>
            than you had wished, but I never want you to worry about me forgetting you :(
            <br>
            You're my bestest friend ever, and you are one of a kind baby.
            <br>
            There's nobody I've met that is as funny, clever, and caring as you.
            <br>
            Nobody else out there can dance the silly way that you do, or make me laugh
            <br>
            about the silliest things. I admire every single passion, hobby, and interest that
            <br>
            you pick up over the years. It's amazing how you see the beauty in the smallest details.
            <br>
            You're such a special person, and I'm lucky that nobody else has snatched
            <br>you up for valentine's day hehehe. The Lord has done amazing work through you bae,
            <br>
            and I pray that He will remain at the center of our relationship so that we may
            <br>
            work together to honour Him. All I can say is that I love you more than words
            <br>
            can express. You are my joy and my happiness, and I thank the Lord for
            <br>
            every day that I get to spend with you.
            <br>
            SO LET'S HAVE A FUN VALENTINE'S TOGETHER THIS YEAR!! YAY :D
